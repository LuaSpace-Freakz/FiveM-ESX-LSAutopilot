# FiveM-ESX-LSHud

Just a basic autopilot which works for ESX. It supports my Hud plugin with the export "IsAutopilotActive" which is self explanatory.

Menu Button: F1

Future plans:
- creating a config.lua
- F1 Button configurable in the GTA settings

Disclamers:
- I am not going to bring this to QBCore
- Support isn't garuanteed (feel free to contact me: https://discordapp.com/users/1161679941075742900)
